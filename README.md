# VRC Event Agent

This project is a simple implementation of an autonomous agent in VRChat, in this case I planned to use it for orchestrating events and wiring up a separate interface, so you can receive invitations by sending an application to an LLM AI agent.
Still working on it, might abandon it, who knows.
Had to create my own API client because the community one was not the best for my use case, too difficult to wire up and manage and didn't like the C# API personally.
